# DummyRepo
A Repository to practice pull request, branches, merges & other stuff.

Anyone is allowed to fork this repository and practice pull request, merge and branch and other stuffs, So that you don't create any mess with your official repository.

Just pick up the file you wish to edit and submit a pull request. I'll be happy to accept. `Just Do It`

Now Coding in a file created by someone else and that too filled up with code of other guys may be frustrating. trust me I know it well. So, Let's all (the ones who fork this repo.) agree to a **CONDITION** that

**"NO matter what code is written earlier, You just comment each & every line of code stuff, leaving only those lines that are necessary to run & at the same time write your own cool code & then do a pull request "**

Have Fun
